# FAQ - Easy Leaderboard

### 1) What is required to use Easy Leaderboard?

> Every required step to use Easy Leaderboard is documented [here](https://bit.ly/2WaxXAS).

### 2) Does Easy Leaderboard work for both Android and iOS?

> Yes.

### 3) Is Easy Leaderboard compatible with Unity 2019?

> Yes.

### 4) Which version of Facebook SDK I must download and use with Easy Leaderboard?

> **v7.15.0** is the recommended and fully compatible version.

### 5) Can my game have multiple leaderboards?

> Yes. Easy Leaderboard does not limit the number of leaderboards your game should have. The one and only limiting factor is your PlayFab plan. Read more about PlayFab pricing plans [here](https://playfab.com/pricing).

### 6) Can I use only the Facebook Login functionality?

> Yes, but the package is built ready to connect a Facebook user to PlayFab, so changes in the package scripts would be necessary.

### 7) Can I use only the leaderboards functionality on PlayFab with an alternative authentication that does not use Facebook?

> Yes, but the package is built ready to log the PlayFab user in authenticating it via Facebook, so changes in the package scripts would be necessary.

### 8) Must I be authorized by Facebook to ask for user permissions in my game?

> Yes. Facebook updated its policies regarding some user permissions ("user_friends" permission is included). So it is required to send them a request asking for their authorization. The request is made on Facebook Developer Dashboard. Read more about it [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/requesting-and-revoking).
